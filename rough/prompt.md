# AiDIY: AI-Powered Step-by-Step Illustration Generator

## Feature: AI-Generated Step-by-Step Illustrations for DIY Projects

### **Objective:**
Create an AI-powered system that generates step-by-step illustrations for DIY projects, making complex instructions easy to follow with visual aids.

### **User Flow:**
1. **User Input:**
   - User selects a category (e.g., woodworking, electronics, home decor, crafting, etc.).
   - They describe their project idea in natural language or choose from a list of pre-existing templates.
   
2. **AI Processing:**
   - The system breaks down the project into structured steps.
   - Each step is analyzed for required tools, materials, and actions.
   - AI generates textual instructions.
   
3. **Illustration Generation:**
   - AI creates corresponding illustrations for each step using a generative model (e.g., DALLÂ·E, Stable Diffusion, or a fine-tuned model on technical drawings).
   - The system ensures consistency in style and logical progression in visuals.
   
4. **References & Enhancements:**
   - The AI fetches relevant reference images and links to similar projects.
   - Users can request alternative visual styles or simplified versions.
   - Interactive elements like animated GIFs or 3D previews (stretch goal).
   
5. **Final Output:**
   - A structured, easy-to-follow DIY guide with step-by-step instructions and visuals.
   - Exportable as PDF, printable format, or interactive web version.
   
### **Tech Stack & Implementation:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), ShadCN for UI
- **Backend:** Express.js + n8n for AI workflow orchestration
- **AI Models:**
  - LLM (Fal API) for step breakdown and instruction generation
  - PicaOS for advanced visual explanations
- **Storage & Database:** PocketBase for storing projects and user-generated content
- **Deployment:** Vercel (frontend), Coolify (backend)

### **Challenges & Solutions:**
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Ensuring step accuracy | AI validation via existing tutorials and user feedback |
| Maintaining illustration consistency | Fine-tuned models on technical and DIY-specific datasets |
| Balancing detail vs. simplicity | User-controlled toggles for complexity levels |
| Efficient processing | Optimized API calls and caching for frequently requested projects |

### **Future Enhancements:**
- **Community Contributions:** Allow users to refine steps and upload real-life results.
- **AR Integration:** Overlay instructions on real objects via a mobile app.
- **Multi-language Support:** Translate text and generate culturally relevant illustrations.
