API Documentation

Overview

[Documentation](/get-started/introduction)
[API Reference](/api-reference/introduction)

Pica provides powerful APIs that enable you to build, deploy, and scale AI agents with seamless access to over 100+ integrations and tools. Connect your AI to QuickBooks, Salesforce, HubSpot, Shopify, and more leading platforms through our Unified API via Common Models to unlock real-time data and automation capabilities.

[​](#vault-api)

Vault API
----------------------------

The Vault API provides endpoints to manage your connectors through listing, deleting, and viewing connection details.

[​](#unified-api)

Unified API
--------------------------------

Our standardized API layer enables LLMs to interact with third-party services through common models. Features include:

*   Integration with QuickBooks, Salesforce, HubSpot, Shopify and [more](https://www.picaos.com/community/connectors)
    
*   Standard CRUD operations across all connectors
*   Built-in authentication and connection management
*   AI SDK support for LLM capabilities

[​](#transaction-keys)

Transaction Keys
------------------------------------------

A `transactionKey` is a unique ID returned as part of the response body for every Pica API response. The `transactionKey` can be used to look up the request in the [logs](https://app.picaos.com/logs)
 and should be included when contacting Support regarding a specific API call.

Authentication

[Documentation](/get-started/introduction)
[API Reference](/api-reference/introduction)

Pica authenticates your API requests using API keys. Include your API key in the `x-pica-secret` header of your requests:

    x-pica-secret: YOUR_API_KEY
    

Need an API key? Sign up for a [Pica account](https://app.picaos.com)

### 

[​](#environments)

Environments

From the dashboard, you can create two different types of API keys that correspond to two distinct environments:

[​](#param-sandbox)

Sandbox

environment

Build out your end-to-end UX safely using test credentials

[​](#param-production)

Production

environment

Launch your new UX confidently using isolated live credentials

[​](#connector-scoping)

Connector Scoping
--------------------------------------------

Connectors are scoped to Environment and cannot be moved between environments once created. Both Sandbox and Production environments include unlimited Connections and unlimited API calls. All testing should be done in the Sandbox environment.
